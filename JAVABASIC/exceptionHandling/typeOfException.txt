The root class of exception handling is Throwable class

1)check exception

java.lang.InterruptedException
Java.io.FileNotFoundException
 Java.sql.SQLException
 
 
2 Unchecked Exception:-

The exceptions which are not checked by the compiler at the time of compilation are called unchecked Exception.
ArithmeticException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,NumberFormatException….etc

Exception handling key words:-
1) try
2) catch
3) finally
4) throw
5) throws

There are two ways to handle the exceptions in java.
1) By using try-catch block.
2) By using throws keyword.


note : if there is no exception in try block the corresponding catch blocks are not checked.

There are three methods to print Exception information
toString()
 getMessage()
 printStackTrace()
